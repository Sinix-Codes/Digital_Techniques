It is the most common form of boolean expression. It is also called the canonical product of sums (CPos) form. Example Consider the following boolean expression: $$ f(x_1, x_2, x_3) = x_1 \\cdot x_2 + x_1 \\cdot x_3 + x_2 \\cdot x_3 $$ This expression can be written in PoS form as: $$ f(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (x_1 + x_2 + x_3) \\cdot (x_1 + x_2 + x_3) \\cdot (x_1 + x_2 + x_3) $$ Properties The PoS form has the following properties: The number of terms in the expression is equal to the number of variables. The number of terms in each product is equal to the number of variables. Each term in the expression is a product of the variables. Each term in the expression is a product of the variables. Each term in the expression is a product of the variables.
