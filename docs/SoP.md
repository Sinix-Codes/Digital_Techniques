# Standard Sum of products (SoP) form

The standard sum of products (SoP) form is a boolean expression that is the sum of products of its variables. It is the most common form of boolean expression. It is also called the canonical sum of products (CSoP) form.

## Example

Consider the following boolean expression:

$$
    f(x_1, x_2, x_3) = x_1 \cdot x_2 + x_1 \cdot x_3 + x_2 \cdot x_3
$$

This expression can be written in SoP form as:

$$
    f(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (x_1 + x_2 + x_3) \cdot (x_1 + x_2 + x_3) \cdot (x_1 + x_2 + x_3)
$$

## Properties

The SoP form has the following properties:

  * The number of terms in the expression is equal to the number of variables.
  * The number of terms in each product is equal to the number of variables.
  * Each term in the expression is a product of the variables.
  * Each term in the expression is a product of the variables.
  * Each term in the expression is a product of the variables.
